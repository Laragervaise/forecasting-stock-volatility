              <p> First, we will analyse the daily log returns of the Dow Jones index. <br>

              Looking at the ACF and PACF, the only signficant lags seems to be 1 or 2. 
              However, after several tests, we got that no Auto-Regressive process is necessary for the mean model. For the volatility process, 
              the first lag is signficant. This means that the volatility of one day affects the next day. </p> <br?

              <p> This is all great but let's talk math now. The most efficient model we found is the GARCH(1,1) with zero mean and
              Student's t distributed errors. The formulas of the model are the following: </p>  <br>
            
              <br>
            
              ADD LATEX FORMULAS <br>
            
              <br>
            
              <p> Fitting the model to the data, we got the following results: </p>   
            
              ADD BASE MODEL SUMMARY TABLE <br>
            
              <br>
                                                                          
              <img src="img/basemodel.png" alt="baseline plot" >
          
              <br>
      
              <p> The performance of this GARCH model is already quite good! But let's see if we can further improve it using Google Trends. </p>
