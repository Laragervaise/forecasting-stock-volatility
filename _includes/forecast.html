              <h2>How much does adding Trends data outperform models not using it?</h2>
            
              <p>Adding to the model the selected Trends data, we get the following performance:</p>
              <img src="img/trendsmodel.png" alt="trends model plot" >

              <p>That is, a <b>20% improvement</p>b> in the forecast!</p>
              <p>This is quite a good performance, and might help you "guessing" when to sell or buy DJI.
              And why not trying it on the NASDAQ index, adding tech-related keywords? Or with Tesla focusing on 'AV' and 'Elon Musk' searches?
              We can't guarantee the result, but we let you <b>test it</p>b>. Or if DJI is your favorite index, you can try to add more relevant keywords, it's up to you! 
              However, be careful about the fact that this model <b>might not perform as well after the recession</b>.</p>
