              <h2>How much does adding Trends data outperform models not using it?</h2>
            
            <p> The most efficient model we found is the GARCH(1,1) with the selected Trends data as mean regressors and Student's t distributed errors. 
              So the same model but we just add trends data as predictors in the mean process.
              The formulas of the model are the following: </p>
            
            <p> ADD LATEX FORMULAS </p>
            
            <p> Fitting the model to the data, we got the following results: </p>
            
            <p> ADD TABLE </p>
              
              <img src="img/trendsmodel.png" alt="trends model plot" >

            <p> We got a mean absolute error o f 0.0044. </p>
            <br>
              <h2>That's 20% improvement in the forecast mean absolute error!</h2>
              
              <p>This is quite a good performance. This might help predicting future increases in volatility which could suggest an upcoming crisis. 
                It can be used to bet against the market by shorting stocks, contracting put options with banks. <br> </p>
                
              <h2>Your turn!</h2>
              <p>Feel free to use this results on another index as the NASDAQ or S&P500. <br>
                <br>
                Or with a particular stock as Tesla by focusing on the keywords 'electric car', 'AV' and 'Elon Musk' searches for example. <br>
                <br>
                Or if DJI is your favorite index, you can try to add more relevant keywords, it's up to you! <br>
                <br>
                We can't guarantee the result, but we let you test it. <br>
                <br>
                However, be careful about the fact that this model might not perform as well after the recession.</p>
